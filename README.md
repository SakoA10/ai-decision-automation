# AI Decision Automation

A simple Python automation project where an AI-style decision decides what is important,
then the automation keeps only those items.

## What it does

- Takes a list of messages
- Decides which ones are important (decision step)
- Outputs only important messages

## Why this matters

Shows the core AI automation pattern:
input → decision → action → output
